			Famous for college basketball, horse racing, bourbon, coal, and bluegrass music, 
			the Commonwealth of Kentucky is also home to industries and opportunities not normally associated with it. 
			Compiled by the Kentucky Entrepreneur Hall of Fame, Unbridled Spirit shares the success stories of twenty of its 
			members—business leaders who dared to think beyond the region’s best known institutions—to encourage the next 
			generation of entrepreneurs from the Bluegrass State.

			Kentucky’s history of being a small impoverished state didn’t stop entrepreneurial Kentuckians like tech inventor and 
			DataBeam founder Lee Todd and former Milwaukee-Bucks-superstar-turned-restaurant-franchiser Junior Bridgeman from overcoming adversity, 
			pursuing their dreams, and achieving their goals. These Hall of Famers, and the others profiled in this book, have built prosperous 
			careers that have redefined what it means to be Kentuckian, inspiring others in communities throughout the Commonwealth to step outside 
			the box and create their own business legacies in twenty-first century America.
