        <div class="bio">
            Nate Morris is the founder of Morris Industries, a Lexington, Kentucky-based conglomerate that is reimagining the industrial economy. Morris's passion to solve the environmental threats posed by global waste was pivotal in his founding of Rubicon, a software company focused on waste and recycling, and the signature asset of Morris Industries.
            <br><br>
            Founded with a $10,000 line of credit, Rubicon now operates in 20 countries on 5 continents, with a valuation in excess of $1 billion.  Under Morris's leadership as Chairman and CEO, Rubicon has become a catalyst for groundbreaking change across the waste management sector while being recognized as "One of the World's Most Innovative Companies" by Fast Company and an "Industry Disruptor" by Inc. Magazine.
            <br><br>
            A ninth-generation Kentuckian, Morris was born in Lexington and raised by a single mother with help from his grandmother and grandfather, an Army veteran and former President of United Auto Workers (UAW) Local 862.
            <br><br>
            A product of Kentucky public schools, Morris graduated from George Washington University as a Scottish Rite Scholar and won an academic fellowship to Princeton University's School of Public and International Affairs.
            <br><br>
            Morris was the first Kentuckian to be named to Fortune Magazine's 40 Under 40 list and to be recognized as a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum. Morris was named a Fulbright Specialist Scholar.
            <br><br>
            He is also the youngest inductee ever to the Kentucky Entrepreneur Hall of Fame.
