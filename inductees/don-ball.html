        <div class="bio">
            Don Ball was born near Henderson, Kentucky in 1936. At the University of Kentucky, he met and married the former Mira Snider, with whom he co-founded the homebuilding company Ball Homes in 1959. It has grown to be Central Kentuckyâ€™s leading home builder, with a strong market presence in Louisville and Knoxville. Ball Homes has been ranked among the top 100 homebuilders in the nation annually since 1998, rising as high as #47 on the list. The company, which continues to be a family-led operation, also now encompasses a development branch, property management, and real estate and mortgage companies.<br><br>
            Mr. Ball was passionate about housing affordability and home ownership, and worked tirelessly to develop creative, resourceful and collaborative ways to benefit others and support his industry. His building experience, combined with his public service experience, allowed him to help establish Recovery Kentucky, a network of innovative residential recovery facilities that address homelessness.
