        <div class="bio">
            James Kirchdorfer, Jr. (or Jimmy as heâ€™s known) is the chairman and CEO of ISCO Industries. 
            A proud alum of the Catholic school system in Louisville, Kentucky, Jimmy then went on to graduate with a degree in business from Miami University.
            Jimmy began his career at ISCO in the early 90s, working summers during college. In 1993, he became one of the first ISCO sales representatives to live outside of Louisville. 
            Working his way through the ranks, he was named general manager, then president, and has been Chairman and CEO since 2010. 
            With humble beginnings in a family hardware store, ISCO has seen tremendous growth over the years and has become a global leader in HDPE piping solutions.
            In 2022, along with three other partners, Jimmy purchased Valhalla Golf Club. He is the General Chair of the 2024 PGA Championship. 
            He was named Ernst & Young 2004 Entrepreneur of the Year for the Kentucky/Ohio region, named one of the Most Admired CEOs by Louisville Business First Magazine in 2019, received the 2020 J.W. Janes award for his contribution to the growth of amateur golf in Kentucky, and was inducted into the Kentucky Golf Hall of Fame 2021 class.
            Jimmy currently serves on several boards, primarily supporting youth golf programs and advancing educational opportunities in Kentucky.
             He resides in Louisville with his wife, Dana, and their two children, Jay and Emma.
