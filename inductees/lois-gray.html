        <div class="bio">
            Lois Howard Gray, one of Kentucky’s first and most successful female entrepreneurs, was the co-founder, alongside her late husband James Norris Gray, of award-winning and top industrial contractor, Gray.
            <br />
            <br />
            After her husband’s untimely death, Lois helped her young son Howard, then 22, who had become the company’s president, keep the business operating. Over time, she helped all her children learn to care for the business and their team members.
            <br />
            <br /> 
            Since the company’s founding in 1960 in Glasgow, KY, Gray has grown into a global fully integrated service provider specializing in engineering, design, construction, digital, equipment manufacturing, and real estate for domestic and international customers across the following markets: Food & Beverage, Manufacturing, Automotive, Distribution, Mission Critical, and Commercial. 
            <br />
            <br />
            With nearly 30 offices across North America, Europe, and Asia, Gray’s robust offering creates customized solutions, delivering unmatched precision and partnership to some of the world’s most sophisticated organizations.
            <br />
            <br />
            Mrs. Gray was chairwoman of the board from 1972 until 2002. She established a culture that focused on the development of people within the business, recognizing that personal growth precedes company growth. 
            <br />
            <br />
            Nurturing people and their emotional commitment to the business were among her greatest passions. This legacy she created continues to positively influence the business today.
