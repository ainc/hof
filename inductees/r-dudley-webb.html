        <div class="bio">
            R. Dudley Webb was born in Letcher County, Kentucky, located in the heart of Appalachia. He is co-founder of The Webb Companies, headquartered in Lexington and currently serves as chairman of the board of directors.  Upon graduating from the University of Kentucky College of Law, Webb established a private law practice. Four years later, he partnered with his brother, Donald W. Webb, to found what is today the law firm of Webb, Hoskins, Brown & Thompson, P.S.C. In 1972, the Webb brothers entered real estate development and investing and formed The Webb Companies, a consolidation of design, development, finance, legal, construction, marketing, leasing, brokerage, property management, and ancillary real estate functions. Under the Webb brothers’ leadership, The Webb Companies grew to become one of the largest real estate developers in the U.S., with projects from New York to San Francisco and Boston to Miami. Today, Webb continues to focus on new development projects, including the $200MM City Center mixed-use complex located in the heart of Lexington’s central business district scheduled to open in the Fall of 2019.   Webb is married to the former Marla Collins of Versailles. They live in Lexington and have three children.        </div>
